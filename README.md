## Projects

. **Portfolio Website**: 
   - **Description**: This website portfolio uses HTML CSS and JavaScript to serve as a dynamic showcase of my skills, experiences, and projects. It features a responsive design with a user-friendly navigation menu, making it accessible on various devices. The website provides valuable information about my background, including my education and proficiency in programming languages. Additionally, it highlights my projects, offering visitors the opportunity to explore my work through GitHub and live demos. With a focus on professionalism and aesthetics, this website effectively communicates my qualifications and ambitions

2. **live spelling checker**: 
   - **Description**: The code demonstrates a simple spelling checker application using Python's tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI) and NLTK for natural language processing. The program creates a tkinter window with a text input area where users can type or paste text. As the user types or modifies the text, the program checks for misspelled words by comparing them against a list of English words from the NLTK corpus. Misspelled words are highlighted in red within the text widget.
Key Features:
The program initializes a tkinter window and a ScrolledText widget for text input.
It uses NLTK to download a list of English words.
The program defines a check method that is called whenever a key is released within the text widget.
Within the check method, it counts the number of spaces in the text and compares it to the previous count to detect word input.
It cleans and tokenizes the input text, highlighting misspelled words in red by applying tkinter tags to the text widget.

                      Looking to use HTML, CSS, and Flask to create a full website and fully flesh out the project!

3. **Predicting and Visualizing Wildfires**: This project used Python and some libraries such as pandas, seaborn, and folium. The project involved the analysis of wildfire data in the state of New York. The dataset was cleaned to remove unnecessary columns, and the analysis was focused on the year 2019. The main objectives were to identify the primary causes of wildfires, map their locations, and create a heatmap for visualizing wildfire distribution.

4. **Text Summarizer**
   The code demonstrates a Python program that performs extractive text summarization using the NLTK library. It tokenizes input text, removes stopwords and punctuation, calculates word frequency, assigns scores to sentences based on word frequency, selects the top-ranked sentences, and combines them to create a summary. The program aims to extract key information from a given text, condensing it into a shorter, more concise form.

6. **Keyword finder**
   The code demonstrates a Python program that extracts keywords from a given text using the NLTK library. It tokenizes the input text, removes stopwords and punctuation, calculates word frequencies, and assigns TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) scores to words. The program then ranks the words based on their TF-IDF scores and selects the top N keywords as the output.
Key Features:
The program tokenizes the input text into words and converts them to lowercase.
It removes stopwords (common words like "and," "the," "in") and non-alphanumeric characters.
Word frequencies are calculated using the Counter class from the collections module.
A simplified TF-IDF score is calculated for each word (assuming a fixed IDF for all words).
Keywords are ranked by their TF-IDF scores and the top N keywords are selected as the output.
